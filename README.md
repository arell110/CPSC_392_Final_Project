# What Makes a Great Candidate to land a job in STEM?
### Gilberto Arellano | CPSC 392 Final Project
Im attempting to create predictive models to figure out what makes a succesful candidate to land a job in tech. 
I will be using data from the 2017 Kaggle survey, in which collected responses in regards to people's salary, education, programming language recommendations, etc.

## Questions to Answer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1) Who is the most ideal candidate to land a job in tech?
What are the characteristics needed to land a job in this field? Are employers targeting people with a college education? Did an internship in undergrad? A couple of portfolios under their belt? Or is having a solid reference enough? I will use a logistic regression model since the output we are predicting is what are the variables needed to land a job. Doing so we can analyze the coefficients and decide which factors has the most impact

### 2) What are the characteristics neede
We are going to use linear regression to determine those with the highest paying jobs. 

### 3) Is there a relation between age and wage?
After plotting the relationship between 'Age' and 'SalaryCompensation', I determined to use Gaussian Mixture as the clustering method since there is no clear seperation in which other models such as DBSCAN would struggle to differentiate.
