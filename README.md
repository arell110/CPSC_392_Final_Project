# What Makes a Great Candidate to land a job in STEM?
### Author: Gilberto Arellano
### CPSC 392 Final Project
Im attempting to create predictive models to figure out what makes a succesful candidate to land a job in tech. 
I will be using data from the largest job searching website, Indeed.com.

## Questions to Answer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are the questions I am attempting to answer and how I will approach each question. 

### Who is the most ideal candidate to land a job in Data Science/Software Engineering?
What are the characteristics needed to land a job in this field? Are employers targeting people with a college education? Did an internship in undergrad? A couple of portfolios under their belt? Or is having a solid reference and good grades is enough?
Since we will be using a lot of categorical variables on what it takes to land a job, I will use a logistic regression model. 

### What are the type of candidates landing the highest paid entry level jobs?
